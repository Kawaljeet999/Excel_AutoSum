# 📊 Excel AutoSum  

## 📌 Overview  
**Excel AutoSum** is a Python script that automates data entry and column-wise summation in an Excel file. Using the `openpyxl` library, this script generates an Excel sheet, fills it with predefined values, computes sums dynamically, and saves the results automatically.  

## 🛠 Features  
✅ Creates an Excel workbook dynamically.  
✅ Fills Column A with a constant value (`12`).  
✅ Fills Column B with sequential numbers (`1-10`).  
✅ Computes and stores sums in Column C.  
✅ Saves the output as **Column_ADD.xlsx**.  
✅ (Optional) Includes an Excel formula-based summation approach.  

## 🏗 How It Works  
1. **Workbook Creation:** The script initializes a new Excel workbook and selects the active sheet.  
2. **Data Insertion:**  
   - Column A is filled with `12`.  
   - Column B is populated with `1-10`.  
3. **Summation Logic:**  
   - The script retrieves values from Columns A and B.  
   - Computes the sum and stores it in Column C.  
   - (Alternatively, an Excel formula can be used by uncommenting the relevant lines).  
4. **Saving the File:** The processed data is saved as `Column_ADD.xlsx`.  

## 🚀 Installation  
Ensure you have **Python** installed and install `openpyxl` using:  

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

## ▶️ Usage  
Run the script with:  

```bash
python Column_Add.py
```

After execution, check the **Column_ADD.xlsx** file in the project directory.  

## 📝 Customization  
- To modify the number of rows, adjust the `range(1, 11)` values.  
- Uncomment the alternative formula-based summation method if needed.  

## 📜 License  
This project is open-source and free to use.
